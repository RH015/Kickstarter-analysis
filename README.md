Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends

#**Kickstarter Analysis**

Since 2009, Kickstarter supports creative minds to fulfill their creative projects through financing. 

For the present analysis, our client Louise wants to carry out her play project, financed on Kickstarter. However, it is necessary to know if the project in mind can be successful and if the budget that she estimates is adequate to start. 

Louise estimates that it will cost $ 12,000 and, we have a Kickstarter database to compare the different projects that are funded on the platform and the level of success so that we can make a financing decision. 

The database contains the following data that could be of most interest to us for analysis: 

*•	Information from 21 countries on creative projects, such as Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film and video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publications, Technology, and Theater. 

*•	Each project is assigned an objective, which tells us how much money it will need to be successful.

•	Each project is also assigned a committed budget, which tells us how much each campaign actually earned. 

•	And the result of each project. 

The information provided has data from 2009 to 2017, enough data to be able to make a decision. 

According to the information obtained, we can say that: 

The results of success in each main category are important. If we look at the theater category, we can see that it is the one with the greatest successes during these 8 years that it has been in the Kickstarter market (as shown in the Parent Category Outcomes graph).

As a result, funded projects have a greater chance of success in the theater category.
However, how successful are the plays Louise wants to do?

The Subcategory Outcomes graph shows us that plays have a higher probability of success than other subcategories that are financed.---

If we compare, the results obtained based on the launch date, we can say that the success of the results in all the main categories after the year of Kickstarter initiation has prevailed.

Although the canceled and failed projects have taken place, the success in the results according to the date in which they started is greater.

However, the results based on the launch date for the Theater projects, which include musicals, plays and spaces, the success remains as almost all the creative projects of Kickstarter since their inception of 2009, the results are shown on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart.

Regarding the results in the theater projects and taking into account the subcategories and the start date of each project, we can say that the possibility of success for Louise's project is seen more clearly.

One of the difficulties encountered in the analysis is that, for some years, the complete base of all the months is not available, so the comparison between years is not always effective, taking into account that the base begins at the beginning From 2009, the year in which the financial crisis began in the United States, we do not have registered information, this could have helped to observe the behavior in the consumption of people for this type of products.---
Finally, the results based on the goals, which tell us how much money will be needed for each campaign, shows that with a Goal of less than $ 1,000, there is 76% of the project being successful and between a Goal greater than $ 10,000 and less than $ 5,000. The result of the project has a 54% success rate. See the Outcomes Based on Goals graph.

In this sense, we can tell Lois that she has a positive margin to be able to start her play with the goal and according to the start date of the play.

Final recommendations:
It seems to me that it could be very helpful if there is a part of the year in which projects start with the greatest possibility of success. One of the limitations is the years that do not have complete information. Differentiate the countries with the greatest success stories in terms of the interested subcategory or all the subcategories in order to minimize the risk of cancellation or failure of the project.

The last graph should be compared with the PLEDGED since it seems that no matter how much the goal is, you can be successful with a little goal or have failures in the project with a lot of goals. It is not explained well what would be the optimal goal level for really lowering the risk of losing the project.---
Finally, it seems that some validations could also be added to be able to corroborate the final results, it could be with a dynamic table with which the totals of each category can be seen according to the goal presented.
